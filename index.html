                <h2>Where I'm from:</h2>
                <p>I was born and raised in Pontotoc, Mississippi. I've lived here all my life and I couldn't have imagined
                    growing up anywhere else. The town of Pontotoc is neither small nor entirely large. It is just the perfect
                    size to the point where everyone knows everyone and we're all, basically, one large, happy family.

                <h2>Education info:</h2>
                <p>I am extremely happy to be a 2017 graduate from Pontotoc High! Two weeks before I graduated, I had no idea
                    what I was going to do or where I was going to go. Luckily, I heard of a computer software engineer school
                    that had just started up in 2016 called
                    <a href="https://basecampcodingacademy.org/" target="_blank">Base Camp</a>. I am currently enrolled at
                    BCCA (Base Camp Coding Academy) and I couldn't be any more satisfied.

                <h2>Projects/Programs Created:</h2>
                <p>Throughout the course of about 4 months, we have made a variety of programs, but the projects I have accomplished
                    below are my favorite. We had a few small programs that we created as a class our first month (June)
                    of Base Camp. The first exciting programs I made was the Gas Pump program in July. It was exciting to
                    see and create programs that people actually make for real world use. Also, in July we were asked to
                    make a student checkin program. I thought it was never going to end because I had so many files and problems,
                    but in the end, I finally got it finished. In August, we finished up our last touches in the Python 3
                    language. I was nervous as our final project in Python became near. We had to choose any topic to make
                    a rental store program on, so I chose to make a motorcycle rental company (the one you see below). The
                    first game we made was the gladiator game. The gladiator game wasn't as hard as I thought it was going
                    to be to build up and add different moves. Now, for my favorite project yet...HELI-ESCAPE! I don't think
                    I've needed so much help or asked as many questions as I've ever had on this game. Osvaldo and I teamed
                    up on creating this game and still seven mile brick walls. The hard work eventually paid off in the long
                    run and we got it finished.</p>
