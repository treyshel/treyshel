                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <h3>High School:</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born and raised in Pontotoc, Mississippi. I've lived here all my life and I couldn't
                    have imagined growing up anywhere else. The town of Pontotoc is neither small nor entirely large. It
                    is just the perfect size to the point where everyone knows everyone and we're all, basically, one large,
                    happy family. I've played football and baseball my whole life, and I love going to Ole Miss sporting
                    events. Currently, I'm *trying* to get good at golf. In high school, I got along with all my teachers
                    and classmates. I make friends easily because I'm a social guy who isn't afraid to break the ice.
                </p>
                <h3>Job Experience:</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found out at a young age that nothing in this world is given to you. In this world, you
                    have to work for what you want. I've made money doing so many different jobs such as working for my friend,
                    working for my friend's dad, working at a grocery store, working for the University of Mississippi, plus
                    more. In my eighteen years of living, I've learned how to wax gym/classroom floors, run a fiber company,
                    set up tents for football tailgaters, stock shelves/unload grocery trucks, yardwork (mow and weedeat),
                    pressure wash, and I can even paint. There's more ways for money to be made on this planet than I thought
                    there was as a young man.
                </p>
                <h3>Education info:</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am extremely happy to be a 2017 graduate from Pontotoc High! Two weeks before I graduated,
                    I had no idea what I was going to do or where I was going to go. Luckily, I heard of a computer software
                    engineer school that had just started up in 2016 called
                    <a href="https://basecampcodingacademy.org/" target="_blank">Base Camp</a>. I am currently enrolled in the second class at BCCA (Base Camp Coding Academy) and I couldn't
                    be any more satisfied.
                </p>
                <h3>Plans After BCCA:</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My classmates and I were about four months in and we were already making beginner
                    websites four months after we didn't have a clue how to even look at code. We come to school fourty hours
                    a week for five days; furthermore, we aren't your normal young adults. Last year, everyone who attended
                    Base Camp landed a job as an entry level software engineer. They set the tone by gaining their job offers,
                    so we plan to keep the trend going by doing the same. I plan to get a job that I love and stick to it.
                    I've always told myself that when I find a position in whatever career I pursued, that I was going to
                    stay at my first job I get hired at.
