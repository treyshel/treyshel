        <h2>Where I'm from:</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in Pontotc, Mississippi. I've lived here all my life and I couldn't have imagined growing up
            anywhere else. Pontotoc has been recognized numerous times for our having such a great education throughout our
            school district. The town of Pontotoc isn't small nor entirely enourmous. It is just the perfect size to the
            point where everyone knows everyone and we all get along. </p>
