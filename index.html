                <h2>About Me:</h2>
                <p>I was born and raised in Pontotoc, Mississippi. I've lived here all my life and I couldn't have imagined
                    growing up anywhere else. The town of Pontotoc is neither small nor entirely large. It is just the perfect
                    size to the point where everyone knows everyone and we're all, basically, one large, happy family. I've
                    played football and baseball my whole life, and I love going to Ole Miss sporting events. Currently,
                    I'm *trying* to get good at golf. In high school, I got along with all my teachers and classmates. People
                    liked me because I was a social guy who wasn't afraid to break the ice.

                <h2>Job Experience:</h2>
                <p>I found out at a young age that nothing in this world is given to you. In this world, you have to work for
                    what you want. I've made money doing so many different jobs such as working for my friend, working for
                    my friend's dad, working at a grocery store, working for the University of Mississippi, plus more. In
                    my eighteen years of living, I've learned how to wax gym/classroom floors, run a fiber company, set up
                    tents for football tailgaters, stock shelves/unload grocery trucks, yardwork (mow and weedeat), pressure
                    wash, and I can even paint. There's more ways for money to be made on this planet than I thought there
                    was as a young man.

                <h2>Education info:</h2>
                <p>I am extremely happy to be a 2017 graduate from Pontotoc High! Two weeks before I graduated, I had no idea
                    what I was going to do or where I was going to go. Luckily, I heard of a computer software engineer school
                    that had just started up in 2016 called
                    <a href="https://basecampcodingacademy.org/" target="_blank">Base Camp</a>. I am currently enrolled in
                    the second class at BCCA (Base Camp Coding Academy) and I couldn't be any more satisfied.

                <h2>Plans After BCCA:</h2>
                <p>My classmates and I are about four months in and we are making beginner websites as eighteen year olds. We
                    come to school fourty hours a week for five days; furthermore, we aren't your normal young adults. Last
                    year, everyone who attended Base Camp landed a job as an entry level software engineer. They set the
                    tone by gaining their job offers, so we plan to keep the trend going by doing the same. I plan to get
                    a job that I love and stick to it. I've always told myself that when I find a position in whatever career
                    I pursued, that I was going to stay at my first job I get hired at.

                <h2>Projects/Programs Created: <a href="https://github.com/treyshel" target="_blank">Github Link <i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h2>
                <p>Throughout the course of about 4 months, we have made a variety of programs, but the projects I have accomplished
                    below are my favorite. We had a few small programs that we created as a class our first month (June)
                    of Base Camp. The first exciting programs I made was the Gas Pump program in July. It was exciting to
                    see and create programs that people actually make for real world use. Also, in July we were asked to
                    make a student checkin program. I thought it was never going to end because I had so many files and problems,
                    but in the end, I finally got it finished. In August, we finished up our last touches in the Python 3
                    language. I was nervous as our final project in Python became near. We had to choose any topic to make
                    a rental store program on, so I chose to make a motorcycle rental company (the one you see below). The
                    first game we made was the gladiator game. The gladiator game wasn't as hard as I thought it was going
                    to be to build up and add different moves. Now, for my favorite project yet...HELI-ESCAPE! I don't think
                    I've needed so much help or asked as many questions as I've ever had on this game. Osvaldo and I teamed
                    up on creating this game and still seven mile brick walls. The hard work eventually paid off in the long
                    run and we got it finished.</p>
