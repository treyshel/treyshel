        <h2>Where I'm from:</h2>
        <br />
        <p>I was born and raised in Pontotoc, Mississippi. I've lived here all my life and I couldn't have imagined growing
            up anywhere else. Pontotoc has been recognized numerous times for our having such a great education throughout
            our school district. The town of Pontotoc isn't small nor entirely enourmous. It is just the perfect size to
            the point where everyone knows everyone and we're all, basically, one large, happy family. </p>
        <h2>Education info:</h2>
        <br />
        <p>I am a 2017 graduate from Pontotoc High. Two weeks before I graduated, I had no idea what I was going to do or where
            I was going to go. Luckily, I heard of a computer software engineer school that had just started up in 2016 called
            <a href="https://basecampcodingacademy.org/" target="_blank">Base Camp</a>. I am currently enrolled at BCCA (Base
            Camp Coding Academy) and I couldn't be any more satisfied.
