                <h2>About Me:</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born and raised in Pontotoc, Mississippi. I've lived here all my life and I couldn't
                    have imagined growing up anywhere else. The town of Pontotoc is neither small nor entirely large. It
                    is just the perfect size to the point where everyone knows everyone and we're all, basically, one large,
                    happy family. I've played football and baseball my whole life, and I love going to Ole Miss sporting
                    events. Currently, I'm *trying* to get good at golf. In high school, I got along with all my teachers
                    and classmates. People liked me because I was a social guy who wasn't afraid to break the ice.

                <h2>Job Experience:</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found out at a young age that nothing in this world is given to you. In this world, you
                    have to work for what you want. I've made money doing so many different jobs such as working for my friend,
                    working for my friend's dad, working at a grocery store, working for the University of Mississippi, plus
                    more. In my eighteen years of living, I've learned how to wax gym/classroom floors, run a fiber company,
                    set up tents for football tailgaters, stock shelves/unload grocery trucks, yardwork (mow and weedeat),
                    pressure wash, and I can even paint. There's more ways for money to be made on this planet than I thought
                    there was as a young man.

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am extremely happy to be a 2017 graduate from Pontotoc High! Two weeks before I graduated,
                    I had no idea what I was going to do or where I was going to go. Luckily, I heard of a computer software
                    engineer school that had just started up in 2016 called
                    <a href="https://basecampcodingacademy.org/" target="_blank">Base Camp</a>. I am currently enrolled in
                    the second class at BCCA (Base Camp Coding Academy) and I couldn't be any more satisfied.

                <h2>Plans After BCCA:</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My classmates and I were about four months in and we were already making beginner websites
                    as eighteen year olds. We come to school fourty hours a week for five days; furthermore, we aren't your
                    normal young adults. Last year, everyone who attended Base Camp landed a job as an entry level software
                    engineer. They set the tone by gaining their job offers, so we plan to keep the trend going by doing
                    the same. I plan to get a job that I love and stick to it. I've always told myself that when I find a
                    position in whatever career I pursued, that I was going to stay at my first job I get hired at.

                <p>Throughout the course of about 4 months, we have made a variety of programs, but the projects I have accomplished
                    below are my favorite. We had a few small programs that we created as a class our first month (June)
                    of Base Camp.

                        exciting program I made was the Gas Pump program in July. It was exciting to see and create programs
                        that people actually make for real world use.

                        because I had so many files and problems, but in the end, I finally got it finished. </li>

                        in Python became near. We had to choose any topic to make a rental store program on, so I chose to
                        make a motorcycle rental company (the one you see below).</li>
                    <li><a href="#glad-game " class="port-links "><i class="icon-python "></i>&nbsp;Gladiator Game:</a>The first
                        game we made was the gladiator game. The gladiator game wasn't as hard as I thought it was going
                        to be to build up and add different moves.</li>

                        my favorite project yet...HELI-ESCAPE! I don't think I've needed so much help or asked as many questions
                        as I've ever had on this game. Osvaldo and I teamed up on creating this game and still seven mile
                        brick walls. The hard work eventually paid off in the long run and we got it finished.</li>
